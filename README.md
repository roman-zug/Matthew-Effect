# Matthew-Effect

This repository contains MATLAB files used for a theoretical model in a scientific paper. The code implements the model, performs simulations, and analyzes the results.

## Repository Structure
- `main.m` – Runs the main analysis.
- `model.m` – Defines the theoretical model.
- `simulation.m` – Runs simulations based on the model.
- `analysis.m` – Processes and analyzes simulation results.
- `data/` – (Optional) Stores example datasets if applicable.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Matthew-Effect.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository folder.
3. Run `main.m` to execute the model.
