# Matthew-Effect

This repository contains MATLAB files used to develop the model and to create the figures in the paper "Luck can explain the positive link between fecundity and
longevity: The Matthew effect in social insects and beyond". The code implements the model, performs simulations, and analyzes the results.

## Repository Structure
- `main.m` â€“ Runs the main analysis.
- `find_optimum.m` - Function to find the optimal x value

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Matthew-Effect.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository folder.
3. Run `main.m` to execute the model.
